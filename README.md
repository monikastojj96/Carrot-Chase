## General info
Overview:
* Carrot Chase is a video game prototype created in Microsoft MakeCode Arcade using Python. The goal is simple: collect as many carrots as possible before the timer runs outs while avoiding being eaten by the snake.
Problem it solves:
* My prototype focuses on an artistic challenge: using Microsoft MakeCode Arcade as a platform for creative expression.
Purpose:
* My objective is to explore how simple tools can be utilised to create a meaningful artistic expereince.
Why I undertook it:
* To combine coding with creative-problem solving, while learning about the link between code, design and player experience.
