## General info
Overview:
* Carrot Chase is a video game prototype created in Microsoft MakeCode Arcade using Python. The goal is to collect as many carrots as possible before the timer runs out while avoiding being eaten by the snake.
* My prototype focuses on an artistic challenge: using Microsoft MakeCode Arcade as a platform for creative expression.
* My objective is to explore how simple tools can be utilised to create a meaningful artistic expereince.
* To combine coding with creative-problem solving, while learning about the link between code, design and player experience.
